# Library Management System

On the early days libraries played a crucial role in preserving and disseminating knowledge. This was done with the help of librarians who devoted their time to keeping their books as organized as possible.

A good librarian would catalog the books in his library to ensure that these could be easily located and acceses by library patrons, manage and track the loans and returns for patrons, manage and track the loans from other libraries and aid patrons on the finding of useful material.

That is a lot of work!

With the upcoming of computers and databases these tasks became easier to manage, specially as the number of books stored in the libraries grew. Now we are, most of the time, able to go to the library without having to speak with the librarian. Although I would ask you to at least say "Hi".

That is definetly and improvement for all. Librarians can focus on keeping the data in their database up to date and helping patrons whenever they need help. It also allows patrons to be independent which improves their experience.

What a feat!

If you are as passionate about SQL, relational databases, normalization, relational integrity and more with a little "graph database-cherry on top" come with me and lets help all those hard-working librarians get a brake.
